  { date: '2010-04', text: "<strong>BEFORE APOCALYPSE</strong> <br> Alice was born in the state of Delaware in the town of Wilmington. Her parents instilled in her making her own decisions and a love of freedom. Few things were forbidden to her. When Alice asked her mom if she could do something - her mother most often replied, “You can do anything that is not forbidden by law.” When she came of age, she went to the College of Health Sciences at the University of Delaware, but she didn't know what would be waiting for her in a year." },
  { date: '2010-08', text: `<strong>DAY 1</strong><br>
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/vs53qu.png" alt="75" style="width:100%; max-width:300px; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><br>
  Alice had been in college when the pandemic hit.<br>
  As panic erupted all around, she barricaded herself in an empty lecture hall with a group of other students, using a cabinet to block the door.<br>
  From the windows, they could see strange, aggressive people wandering the campus, and the whole building echoed with blaring sirens.<br>
  They kept trying to call 911, but the signal soon went dead.<br>
  The group agreed to wait — surely help would come soon.<br>
  There were five of them in the room.<br>
  Luckily, they had brought a little food with them.<br>
  But no help came.<br>
  They spent the night there, waiting.<br><br>
  <strong>DAY 2</strong><br>
  In the morning, they were still holding onto hope, checking their phones for any signal.<br>
  One girl kept saying, "Someone will come for us. They'll save us."<br>
  But outside, it was almost empty.<br>
  Just smoke, distant screams, and occasionally, gunshots.<br>
  When the sun rose, the sirens stopped.<br>
  And the silence that followed made things feel even worse.<br>
  When they ran out of water, Tom had to carefully go out into the hallway to get some from the cooler.<br>
  Just as he was about to return to the lecture hall, he came face-to-face with a walker for the first time.<br>
  It was at the other end of the corridor, walking straight toward him.<br>
  From its clothes, it was obvious — it used to be one of their professors.<br>
  Tom rushed back inside, and they barricaded the door again.<br>
  For hours afterward, they could still hear a faint knocking.<br>
  Their professor hadn’t stopped trying to get in.<br>
  Alice overheard David muttering to himself: “Four walls, five people, two doors.”<br>
  He repeated it over and over.<br>
  When she looked at him more closely, she saw he was sharpening the edge of his metal ruler.<br>
  She pretended not to notice.<br>
  Eventually, they realized they couldn’t stay there any longer.<br>
  They had no food, no water.<br>
  James said he had a car parked in the college lot.<br>
  They just had to figure out how to reach it.<br>
  <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/7h2bwo.png" alt="75" style="width:100%; max-width:300px; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><br>
  It was a risk, no doubt about it.<br>
  The siren that had been blaring all of yesterday had drawn too many of them to the front entrance.<br>
  But waiting was no longer an option.<br>
  They weren’t starving yet, and they still had the strength to run.<br>
  One by one, they climbed out the window onto the platform.<br>
  From the front of the building, the guttural moans of the walkers were loud and clear—dozens of them, maybe more.<br>
  Carefully, they dropped down to the lower platform, then to the ground.<br>
  The moment their feet hit the pavement, they sprinted.<br>
  James led the way.<br>
  His car was parked just a short distance away, past a row of parked vehicles.<br>
  They were so close.<br>
  And then—chaos.<br>
  From between two cars, a walker lunged and dragged James down.<br>
  The sound of his body hitting the pavement was muffled only by his scream.<br>
  The thing bit into him immediately—shoulder, neck, chest—tearing through flesh like paper.<br>
  Alice froze.<br>
  Her mind blanked out everything but the sight of James thrashing beneath that thing.<br>
  Her chest tightened.<br>
  Her legs trembled.<br>
  She couldn't move.<br>
  Couldn't breathe.<br>
  Her ears rang with panic.<br>
  Behind them, more infected began to spill in from the building.<br>
  The snarling grew louder.<br>
  Tom reacted first.<br>
  Without thinking, he snatched the car keys from where James had dropped them, grabbed Alice’s wrist and pulled hard.<br>
  “Move! We have to go! Now!”<br>
  Nina let out a sob and covered her mouth.<br>
  David stood in shock for a heartbeat longer, his eyes wide and unfocused.<br>
  Then he turned and ran after Tom, not saying a word.<br>
  They didn’t even have time to look back.<br>
  As the group made it to the car, Alice stumbled into the back seat, her hands shaking.<br>
  She could still hear James's screams.<br>
  They left him behind.<br>
  And that truth lodged itself deep in her chest like a splinter.<br>
  With heavy hearts, they drove south, leaving the university behind.<br>
  Alice sat silently in the back seat, her thoughts stuck on James — on how quickly it had all happened, and whether her parents were still safe somewhere out there.<br>
  The road ahead felt endless, the scenery a blur of trees, smoke, and scattered wreckage.<br>
  <br>
  Once they got out of the city, Tom reached over and turned on the car radio.<br>
  For a moment there was static, then a voice broke through — a trembling radio host, speaking of the outbreak, the violence, the warning for people to stay inside, to find shelter and not approach the infected.<br>
  <br>
  “We’re going to Washington,” Tom said, eyes fixed on the road.<br>
  <br>
  David snapped, “What the fuck for?”<br>
  <br>
  Tom didn’t flinch. “If there’s any place in America that’s safe right now, it has to be D.C. — they’ll have walls, soldiers, order... something.”<br>
  <br>
  He glanced down at the dashboard. The fuel gauge was nearing a quarter tank. He exhaled sharply.<br>
  “But we’ll need gas soon. And food. Maybe luck, too.”<br>
  <br>
  Alice didn’t say a word. Her hand was still shaking.<br>
  <br>
  Alice looked at Nina from the backseat. She was always the strongest among them, the loudest, the first to snap back when professors pushed too hard. But now her knuckles were white from gripping her sleeves.<br>
  After a while, the car rolled to a stop near a fuel pump. The gas station building looked looted. Windows shattered, shelves overturned, glass and debris scattered across the floor like confetti at a funeral.<br>
  Tom sighed and turned the key, killing the engine.<br>
  <br>
  "Let’s hope they haven’t siphoned everything already," he muttered, squinting through the windshield at the ransacked building.<br>
  He exhaled sharply. "Shit... If those infected things are inside, we’ve got nothing to fight them with."<br>
  <br>
  "What if we check the trunk?" David said. For once, he had a point.<br>
  Inside the trunk, they found a few scattered tools—an old crowbar, a rusted tire iron, even a heavy wrench. Makeshift weapons, but better than nothing.<br>
  <br>
  The girls stayed in the car, watching nervously as Tom and David approached the building. They moved quietly, trying not to draw attention. The air smelled of fuel, rot, and something metallic.<br>
  Inside the building, the dim light filtered through the shattered windows. Two walkers shuffled between the aisles. Their skin hung off their bones like wet paper.<br>
  <br>
  Tom whispered, "We go in fast. Quiet if we can. Hit hard if we can’t."<br>
  David nodded, gripping the crowbar so tight his knuckles turned white. They slipped inside, careful not to kick debris. For a moment, it looked like the walkers hadn’t noticed them—<br>
  Until a can rolled.<br>
  The nearest walker turned with a wet, guttural hiss. Then the other. They moved faster than expected.<br>
  <br>
  "Shit!"<br>
  Tom swung the tire iron straight into the first one’s face, bone cracking on impact. David lunged at the second, ramming his crowbar into its chest—but it didn’t stop. The thing snarled, stumbled forward, and bit down on David’s forearm before he could wrench it away.<br>
  <br>
  "FUCK—"<br>
  Tom turned, smashing its skull in just in time to stop it from biting again.<br>
  David staggered back, clutching his arm. Blood oozed through his fingers.<br>
  <br>
  "You okay?" Tom panted.<br>
  <br>
  "Yeah. Yeah, it just... got me a little. Didn’t go deep, I think."<br>
  Tom helped David up, looking at the half-smashed skulls on the floor. He didn’t say anything. There was no time.<br>
  <br>
  "Let’s get the gas and get the hell out of here."<br>
  They managed to refuel and even found a few cans of food inside the gas station. It was quiet — too quiet — but luck, for once, seemed to be on their side.<br>
  <br>
  When they returned to the car, Alice immediately noticed the bloody tear on David’s forearm.<br>
  <br>
  "Oh shit," she said, eyes widening. "We need to clean that. Right now. There should be a first-aid kit in the car."<br>
  <br>
  She climbed into the back seat, rummaging through the storage until she found it. Her hands worked quickly, instincts kicking in. She poured antiseptic over the wound, making David flinch, then started wrapping it with clean gauze and bandages.<br>
  <br>
  "You’ll have a nasty scar," she said with a small, tired smile, trying to lighten the mood. "But you’re gonna be okay."<br>
  <br>
  David gave a shaky laugh. "Awesome. Always wanted one."<br>
  They kept driving. Alice's eyes kept catching glimpses of walkers they passed along the road. At some point, she simply leaned her head against the window and fell asleep. When she woke up, it was already dark. Nina was sleeping on her right, and Tom was gripping the wheel, eyes fixed on the dimly lit road ahead.<br>
  <br>
  “How much further?” Alice asked, her voice startling Tom slightly. He glanced at her quickly before turning back to the road.<br>
  <br>
  “Under normal conditions, we’d be there in a couple of hours,” he said. “But now... I can’t go too fast. Gotta stay sharp. I’d say another three, maybe four hours.” He hesitated, then quietly added, “I’m sorry about James. I keep thinking... I could’ve pulled him out. Instead, I ran.”<br>
  <br>
  Alice looked at his reflection in the rearview mirror, her expression soft. “Yeah... I feel the same. If it weren’t for his car, I don’t know what we would’ve done. But... If you hadn’t pulled us together and led us to it, we might’ve ended up just like him.”<br>
  <br>
  Tom sighed, resting his forehead lightly against the steering wheel for a moment. But then, a groan came from David, breaking the silence.<br>
  Tom turned to look. David was sweating, his face pale and twisted with discomfort. Alice leaned forward and gently placed her hand on his forehead.<br>
  “He’s burning up... Looks like a serious infection. Probably sepsis. We need antibiotics. Now.”<br>
  Tom cursed under his breath. “Shit..”<br>
  He glanced at the fuel gauge again. “He might not survive the ride. If we’re lucky, he’s got a few hours before it gets worse. We need to stop somewhere... somewhere with a pharmacy.”<br>
  “We should pull into the next town we see,” Alice said, urgency creeping into her voice. “Any longer and it could be too late.”<br>
  “Alright,” Tom muttered, eyes scanning the road. “But we move quick. Get what we need and get out.”<br>
  Ten minutes later, they were near the small town. It was pitch dark. Alice didn’t take her eyes off David. He was clearly getting worse. She shook his shoulder to bring him back to consciousness.<br>
  “Hey...”<br>
  David opened his eyes and looked at her. The whites of his eyes had a yellowish tint. Alice looked at him with sympathy.<br>
  “Looks like the sepsis is spreading… It’s okay. We’ll find a pharmacy and get you back on your feet.”<br>
  “...I feel like shit…” David muttered with a crooked smile before coughing.<br>
  Nina woke up.<br>
  “What? David, are you feeling sick?”<br>
  Alice replied,<br>
  “He has sepsis. We’re going to stop by a pharmacy to get antibiotics… It’s our only chance of getting him to Washington alive.”<br>
  At the entrance to the town, a sign read: “Middletown.” Tom turned off the engine and parked near the edge of the road. He looked back at the passengers and said,<br>
  “Driving in any further would be dangerous. Nina, stay with David. Alice and I will find his medicine.”<br>
  Tom and Alice quietly walked down the dark street, avoiding walkers. Eventually, they spotted the pharmacy and moved closer. The ground was littered with fresh walker corpses.<br>
  “Someone’s been here recently…” Tom whispered.<br>
  Then, two people stepped out of the pharmacy with duffel bags, their paths lit by flashlights.<br>
  “Antibiotics…” Alice whispered under her breath.<br>
  Tom silently shook his head.<br>
  Alice, gathering her courage, stood up and moved toward the strangers by the pharmacy. Tom grabbed her arm.<br>
  “Don’t be stupid, stay down...”<br>
  “We came for antibiotics!” Alice said, brushing off Tom’s hand and walking forward.<br>
  The two strangers immediately turned their flashlights on her, blinding her with the beams.<br>
  “Don’t move another step!” one of them barked.<br>
  Tom stepped up beside her. “We don’t want trouble… But we do need medicine.”<br>
  Alice went on, “Please… give us antibiotics. Otherwise, our friend is going to die.”<br>
  The strangers’ faces were completely obscured by the glare. A few seconds of tense silence passed. Then came a sharp voice,<br>
  “Go to hell!”<br>
  Both of them turned and walked off quickly. Alice sighed, and Tom gently placed a hand on her shoulder.<br>
  “You tried…”<br>
  When they entered the pharmacy, the shelves were completely bare. Nothing was left.<br>
  “No, no, no…” Alice grabbed her head in frustration. Tom said nothing. Tears welled up in her eyes as she rummaged through every inch of the pharmacy, only to realize there was absolutely nothing left.<br>
  “This isn’t fair,” she said, kneeling and touching the empty shelves in the dark. “This isn’t fair! David’s going to die…”<br>
  Her sobs grew heavier until she collapsed on the floor in despair, covering her eyes with her hand. Just the smell of dust and the cold floor... Then, suddenly, she stopped crying. Something clicked. She turned her head to the side, peering into the gap between the empty shelf and the floor. She reached her arm in, fingers blindly searching—until she touched a small bottle.<br>
  Pulling it out and bringing it closer to her face, she managed to read the label. She whispered aloud:<br>
  “Ceftriaxone…”<br>
  Alice smiled and looked at Tom with tear-streaked eyes.<br>
  “We’re going to save David.”<br>
  Tom smiled back and offered her his hand to help her up.<br>
  “We’re getting him to Washington.”<br>
  Back at the vehicle, they opened the rear doors. David looked awful, his gaze vacant and unfocused.<br>
  “Nina, grab the syringes from the medkit,” Tom said.<br>
  Nina nodded and reached over the back seat into the trunk.<br>
  “David… he was coughing up blood… he’s really bad,” she said, handing the syringe to Alice.<br>
  As she drew the antibiotic into the syringe, Alice said,<br>
  “We’re getting him to Washington...”<br>
  She disinfected the injection site and administered the antibiotic. Then, smiling faintly, she patched up the spot with a bandage. Placing her hand on David’s shoulder, Alice told him softly,<br>
  “It’s okay. You’re going to feel better now.”<br>
  David looked as if he were staring right through her, but he nodded and quietly said,<br>
  “Thank you...”<br>
  “Sleep. You need the rest,” Alice said, sitting beside him in the back seat. They continued heading south.` },
